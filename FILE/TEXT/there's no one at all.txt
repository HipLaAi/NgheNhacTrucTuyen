Ahh, I don't
(Don't wanna make up)
Don't wanna make up, headstrong
Gonna wake up, so long
I kinda died hard, and grew
Seeing that part of you
I never knew love
Somehow I'm pretty sick of that vow
Swallowing down that pain
Wearing the crown unchained
Closing my eyes, I hear your sigh oh
Catching the light, still hear your whine oh
Watching you lie, losing my mind oh
Wishing you'd die
Don't even try oh, this is goodbye
Drying that tear oh, wing it and
Drive away from here oh
Still asking why-why-why-why-why-why?
There's no one at all (ah ah ah)
There's no one at all (ah ah ah)
There's no one at all (ah ah ah)
There's no one at all (oh oh oh)
No one at all (oh oh oh)
Got no one at all (oh oh oh)
Got no one at all (ah ah ah)
Got no one at all (oh oh oh)
Ran after you, got no doubt
God waiting there knocked me out
He let me see whatever
You hide from me since the day we loved lesser
Burned the promise we make faster
Than hurricane flooding river
You took me, leaving nothing
So did it feel that good, see my soul bleeding?
Closing my eyes, I hear your sigh oh
Catching the light, still hear your whine oh
Watching you lie, losing my mind oh
Wishing you'd die
Don't even try oh, this is goodbye
Drying that tear oh, wing it and
Drive away from here oh
Still asking why-why-why-why-why-why?
There's no one at all (ah ah ah)
There's no one at all (ah ah ah)
There's no one at all (ah ah ah)
There's no one at all (oh oh oh)
No one at all (oh oh oh)
Got no one at all (oh oh oh)
Got no one at all (ah ah ah)
Got no one at all (oh oh oh)
(No one at all, no one all, no one at all)
No one at all
Got no one at all
Got no one at all
Got no one at all
There's no one at all
No one at all, ah
