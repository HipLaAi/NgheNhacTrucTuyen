Moon looking bright tonight
High in the sky like trying to keep you alive
Alright, just stay away from me, let me down easily
You're too late, you're too late
Don't you pray? Don't you pray?
Seeking for my embrace, wanting my touch, begging me to stay
Every night and day, calling my name, shout it 'til you break
You took my heart, held it and ripped it apart
Made me your prisoner, got me going right under
Feeling that you feign, fooling me again
No need to explain, taking my own lane
God's helping me out, get over my doubt
Thought I can't live without, forget you right now
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
(Making my way, making my way)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
(Making my way, making my way)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
(Making my way, making my way)
Ah-ah-ah-ah
(Making my way, making my way)
Ah-ah-ah-ah
(Making my way, making my way)
I wanna know the cure for all that time you make me endure
All the words you say ought to keep your prey well and behaved
I reckon it's time, betting my luck on dimes
Taking new leap in, getting far away from your cheating
Seeking for my embrace, wanting my touch, begging me to stay
Every night and day, calling my name, shout it 'til you break
You took my heart, held it and ripped it apart
Made me your prisoner, got me going right under
Feeling that you feign, fooling me again
No need to explain, taking my own lane
God's helping me out, get over my doubt
Thought I can't live without, forget you right now
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
(Making my way, making my way)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
(Making my way, making my way)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
(Making my way, making my way)
Ah-ah-ah-ah
(Making my way, making my way)
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Telling me, "I'll kill for you"
Like a truth, with no proof
Never knew was a doll
Now the thing you pulled never make me yield
Pin you down like a golden view
Right uphill, make you dwell
What I feel? Wish you well
Living right in the kingdom I built anew
Telling me, "I'll kill for you"
Like a truth, with no proof
Never knew was a doll
Now the thing you pulled never make me yield
Pin you down like a golden view
Right uphill, make you dwell
What I feel? Wish you well
Living right in the kingdom I built anew
Draining tears and wallow in guilt
